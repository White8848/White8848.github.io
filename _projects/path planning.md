---
* Designed an advanced algorithm that directly utilizes ENC vector data, eliminating inaccuracies from raster map conversions.
* Integrated a dynamic constraint model based on ship motion characteristics, ensuring safe navigation and accurate trajectory tracking.
* Optimized the algorithm, achieving a remarkable 50% reduction in time cost and delivering shorter navigation routes compared to RRT and RRT* algorithms
