* Spearheaded the development of an OpenCV-centric automatic targeting system tailored for infantry/hero robots. Employed cutting-edge computer vision techniques to streamline target identification.
* Formulated algorithms to calculate camera-to-target distances for both monocular and binocular vision. These calculations enabled precise deck identification, trajectory prediction, and armor plate targeting.
* Successfully crafted embedded programs for sentinel robots, facilitating cloud-controlled chassis movement and vertical adjustments. This pivotal development enabled seamless cloud-based control and automation of sentinel robots.
* Innovated a fully automated sentinel aiming system that integrated automatic movement and accurate targeting. This achievement marked a significant stride in enhancing the sentinel robots' functionality, optimizing their ability to engage and neutralize enemy robots.
