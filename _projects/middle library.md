* Orchestrated team preparations and participation in the RoboMaster robot competition, defining the annual competition strategy and guiding the team towards success.
* Designed an embedded middle-level library, implementing versatile control algorithms for diverse scenarios including motion Kalman filtering and McNum wheel/steering wheel chassis solutions.
* Spearheaded the creation of diverse libraries such as motor, IMU, custom controller, and PC communication protocols, enriching the project's foundation.
* Engineered infantry robot motion system control code, while integrating an automatic aiming system. These enhancements elevated the functionality and performance of the robots for the competition.
