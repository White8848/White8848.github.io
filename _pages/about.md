Hey there!ðŸ‘‹

I'm Qinghua He, and my fascination with robotics has been a lifelong journey. From my early days as a junior high school student dabbling in contact robots to my current pursuit as an undergraduate at China University of Petroleum (Beijing), robotics has been my guiding light.
Back in junior high, I was already immersed in the world of robotics as a contact robot enthusiast. Those formative years ignited a spark within me, propelling me to explore the realms of advanced control theory, navigation algorithms, and beyond.

Throughout high school and college, I fueled my passion by actively participating in numerous robotics competitions. These experiences weren't just about winning or losing; they were about pushing boundaries, learning from failures, and celebrating triumphs with fellow robotics enthusiasts.

Now, as a Robot Engineering major, I'm harnessing the knowledge and skills gained from those early days and competition challenges. My dream? To be a robotics scientist who leaves an indelible mark on the field by pioneering groundbreaking research and innovations.

Beyond robotics, I find solace in creating curitboards and designing machines that blend the artistry of creation with the precision of engineering. It's a delightful balance that keeps my mind engaged and my creativity flowing.

Welcome to my website, where you can journey alongside me through the exciting world of robotics. Explore my projects, delve into my research explorations, and share in the excitement of what the future holds for technology and innovation. Whether you're a fellow robotics enthusiast, a student with dreams of your own, or simply curious about the endless possibilities, I'm thrilled to connect with you.

Feel free to drop me an emailâ€”let's exchange ideas, stories, and visions as we embark on this incredible robotics odyssey together!
