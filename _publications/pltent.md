## Abstract
The present invention relates to the technical field of security robots, and specifically relates to a security patrol robot based on mcnemonic wheels, comprising: a frame; four mcnemonic wheels, mounted to the frame, the four said mcnemonic wheels being set up to be independently driven; a rotary table, attached to said frame; a launching system, attached to said rotary table, capable of rotating with respect to said rotary table; and a bullet supply system, attached to said frame. The robot of the present invention can be used to assist front-line security, staff in dangerous, high-intensity work environment to complete the investigation, prevention and control tasks, in particular, the robot has good flexibility, with its bullet supply, launch system can maintain a continuous lock on the target personnel in complex environments, improve the control ability of the target personnel, to solve the front-line security personnel work intensity, the risk of cross-infection in close proximity, Rapid deployment trouble and other problems, effectively saving human resources, greatly improving productivity and efficiency.
